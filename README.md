# Initial research
## Executive functions
- planning
- fluid inteligence
- self regulation
- mental flexibility
- inhibitory control
- working memory

## Initial research on existing testing methods
The is huge amount of several methods for testing persons executive functions. Methods itself are relatively easy to come by, main issue lies within their standardization, execution or evaluation. 
Some tests require presence of examiner or require proprietary testing materials. Another concenrn is evaluation of gathered test data. While paid tests ussualy come with standardized data used for comparison, freely accesible methods often lack such data. 
As result, most methods would require custom study to calibrate said test (test battery).

## List of found methods
### mini-SEA
- no detailed specification of testing method found
- requires examiner

### Test of Attentional Performance (TAP) tests
- proprietary?

### Wisconsin card sorting test
- good candidate for game
- requires calibration as there are no publicaly avialable data

Subject is given no rules and is tasked with matching presented card with other presented. After matching said card he is given feedback. Usual categories for matching are: color, shape, distribution of shapes on card.

### Iowa gambling task
- good fit for a game
- requires calibration

Subject is presented with 4 pacs of card. Each card yield certain amount of currency and has specific chance of penalty. Subject is tasked to make profit. Cards with higher yield have higher penalty, thus they are not benefitial in the long rune. Subject needs to deduce rules and overcome urge to get large sums of money and prefer positive yield in the long term.

### Stroop test
- good fit

Subject is presented with congruent and incongruent stimuli. Incongruent stimuli refers to mismatch between color of the text and its meaning. Subjects typicaly take longer to respond to incongruent stimuli.

### Complex figure test
- good fit
- complex evaluation

Subject is presented with complex line drawing. Then is tasked to reproduce it by hand with image still visible. Immedietly after is tasked to reproduce image from memory. Same reprofuction is repeated after longer delay (~30min).

### Tower of london test
- good fit
- tests planing

Subject is presented with two boards. One represents desired configuration and the other is in different configuration. Subject is tasked to reconfigure seconds board into first one in fewest steps possible.

### Trail making test (TMT)
- good fit
- publicaly avialable data

Subject is presnted with board of numbers / letters. Subject is tasked with connection them in order with a line.

### Paced auditory serial addition (PASAT)
- requires audio output device

Subject is sequentialy presented a series of numbers. Subject is tasked with sum of two most recent numbers. 


### Continuous Atention Test (aka T.O.V.A)
- reaction time
- game representatin
- long (~20min)

Subject is presented binary set of images. Subject is tasked with pressing a button when certain image appears, otherwise do nothing.

## Favorable methods for self testing and evaluation
Selection of following test consider digital integration of testing method, as well as their evaluation.
NOTE: While requiring quite large amount of subjects, calibration of following methods could be feasible.

### Trail making test (TMT) - (best fit)
data - (https://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/misc/MPI-Leipzig_Mind-Brain-Body-LEMON/Behavioural_Data_MPILMBB_LEMON/Cognitive_Test_Battery_LEMON/TMT/)

### Stroop test
test - (https://ryanwingate.com/projects/hypothesis-testing-2/stroop/)
While easy to implement, no public data for evaluation were found.

### Paced auditory serial addition (PASAT)
manual - (http://www.pasat.us/PDF/PASAT_Manual.pdf)

### Tower of london test
- no data 

### Wisconsin card sorting test
- no data

# Possible approach
Most testing method would be viable if study of large enoung subjects was made to calibrate said test. 
Most test are usualy standardized with N~= 100. (higher = better)
